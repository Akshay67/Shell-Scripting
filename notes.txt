* env - when user enter this command then it showing all environment variables inside the /etc/passwd. and also showing the shell name for e.g bash,zsh
* consider one example file name:-  environmentVariable.sh
-------------------------
	#!/bin/zsh
	echo $hello #Here hello is an environment variable name
-------------------------
# Above example content one variable name `$hello`. and if you run the file "./environmentVariable.sh" then you will get the blank output. so first we need to assign some value to the `$hello` variable. To assign the value to env variable is :- "export env hello=Myvalue". and then you run the "./environmentVariable.sh" script then you will get the output as `Myvalue`

* So now if you want to unset the variable then just type the "unset hello" and after this when you run the "./environmentVariable.sh" then you will get the blank output.

* If suppose already existing environment variable holding some path and you want to overload the another path to same variable without loosing existing path then use this:-
# export hello=$hello : "New value"
-- So the output is like :- Myvalue: New Value

* What is reason behind the `export` keyword :- Suppose user change the shell using `bash` command then previous shell stored path is not working in new shell. but if you set the path using `export` keyword then it works on every shell.
